\section*{Introduction}
ICTU Community is a Kotlin-based mobile application tailored to university environments. It provides information flow and academic management for students, teachers, staff, and administrators. The backend is implemented with Node.js/Express while Supabase serves as the database.

\section{User Roles and Features}
\subsection{Students}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Read feeds, news, and newsletters (field-specific: coding, marketing).
  \item Access class schedules and recordings.
  \item Receive alerts for exams, CA, resits.
  \item Notifications for assignments and registrations (experimental).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Teachers}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Publish courses and upload materials.
  \item Create and send assignments.
  \item Read feeds, news.
  \item Assign class delegates from enrolled students.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Staff}
Basic features:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Manage timetables and classrooms.
  \item Handle administrative requests (transcripts, registration).
  \item Publish campus-wide announcements.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Administrators}
\begin{itemize}
  \item CRUD user accounts and manage roles.
  \item Configure system settings (semester dates, policies).
  \item Moderate feed and news content.
\end{itemize}

\section{System Architecture}
\subsection{Frontend}
Kotlin Android application employing MVVM architecture. Components include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item ViewModels using LiveData or StateFlow.
  \item Retrofit for REST API communication.
  \item Hilt/Koin for dependency injection.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Backend}
Node.js with Express framework. Key patterns:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Controllers and services per domain (users, feeds, notifications).
  \item JWT for authentication and RBAC.
  \item RESTful endpoints with JSON responses.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Database}
Supabase (PostgreSQL) with tables for users, roles, feeds, classes, assignments, notifications. Row-level security enforces access policies.

\section{Requirements}
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item User authentication and authorization.
  \item CRUD operations for all major entities.
  \item Real-time or push notifications.
  \item File uploads and streaming for lectures.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Performance: API latency <200ms.
  \item Scalability: handle thousands of concurrent users.
  \item Security: HTTPS, JWT, RLS.
  \item Maintainability: modular, documented codebase.
  \item Usability: intuitive UI/UX, accessibility.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Patterns}
\begin{itemize}
  \item MVVM (frontend).
  \item Repository pattern for data access.
  \item Observer pattern for notifications.
  \item Singleton for shared services.
  \item Dependency Injection (Hilt/Koin).
\end{itemize}
